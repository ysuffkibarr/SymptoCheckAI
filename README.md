# SymptoCheckAI

SymptoCheckAI is a lightweight web application that predicts possible diseases based on user-entered symptoms. By leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, it compares symptoms against a curated dataset to provide the most probable disease matches quickly and accurately.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository
   
   git clone https://github.com/YusufKibar/SymptoCheckAI.git
   cd SymptoCheckAI
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac  
  venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
  
Install dependencies:

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
Run the application:

  python symptom_classifier.py

Open your browser and go to:

  http://localhost:8000
  API Endpoints
  POST /api/analyze

Input: JSON with "symptoms": "symptom text"

Output: JSON with top predicted diseases, similarity scores, matched symptoms, and descriptions

GET /api/symptoms

Output: JSON list of all symptoms in the dataset

How It Works
The app loads a CSV dataset of diseases and their associated symptoms.

Symptoms for each disease are combined into a text corpus and vectorized using TF-IDF.

When a user inputs symptoms, their text is vectorized and compared to the dataset via cosine similarity.

The system returns the top N diseases with the highest similarity scores, along with matched symptoms and descriptions.

Future Improvements
Implement advanced machine learning or deep learning models for higher accuracy

Expand and clean the symptom and disease dataset for better coverage

Add user authentication for personalized features

Improve frontend UI/UX with modern frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)

Deploy to cloud platforms with containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)

Add multi-language support
